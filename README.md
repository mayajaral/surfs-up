# Surfs Up: An Analysis of Weather Data
## Overview
This project analyzes the temperature data of Oahu to determine the viability of a surf and ice-cream shop. The surf and ice-cream shop requires year round customers, which would be contingent of the weather conditions for surfing and thus for ice-cream consumption.

The key differences between the June & December data are:-
1. The mean temperature in June is 74.94 compared to a mean of 71.04 in December.
2. The temperature at 25%, 50% and 75% is 4 degrees higher in June than in December.
3. The minimum temperature in June is 64 and in December is 56.

## Summary
Both June and December see a standard deviation of 3 degrees, and given the relatively small differences between the means and the minimum temperatures. This indicates that the temperature differences between the months is not very high. This indicates that the year round temperature does not fluctuate much, providing a good environment for regular customers. This indicates that the surf and ice-cream shop would be viable.

Additional Queries
1. Queries comparing the temperature fluctuations over time could provide temperature trends to consider longterm viability.  
2. The percipitation data would be useful, as uniform temperatures with high rainful would hurt the customers.
